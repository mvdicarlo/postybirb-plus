## Download PostyBirb+ 3.X
PostyBirb+ is the most current version of the app. V2 is lacking support. [Differences between 3.X and 2.X are found here.](https://www.postybirb.com/whats-new-in-30-postybirb.html)
- [Windows](https://github.com/mvdicarlo/postybirb-plus/releases/download/v3.1.37/postybirb-plus-setup-3.1.37.exe)
- [MAC/OSX](https://github.com/mvdicarlo/postybirb-plus/releases/download/v3.1.37/postybirb-plus-3.1.37.dmg)
- [Linux](https://github.com/mvdicarlo/postybirb-plus/releases/download/v3.1.37/postybirb-plus-3.1.37-x86_64.AppImage)

## Open Source
PostyBirb's code is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/mvdicarlo/postybirb-plus).

## Like PostyBirb?
Please consider telling people you know about it. I don't have a good way to spread awareness of this application, so any help is appreciated.

## Installation
Installation is easy and can be done in a few steps

1. Click on Download
2. Download for whatever operating system you are using
3. Install & Launch
    1. If Mac complains, right click on it and click 'open' and it should work.
    2. Protection programs (i.e. avast, norton, etc.) may complain, but just tell it to run or add it to the exception list.
        3. This mostly happens because I don't have the money to sign my code or just due to its obscurity.
4. If the Windows version has problems try using the non-setup/installer versions (e.g. PostyBirb.0.5.9.exe or PostyBirb-0.5.9-win.zip)
