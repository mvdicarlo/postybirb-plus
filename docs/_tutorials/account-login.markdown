When you first launch the application you will need to login to any websites that you intend to post to.

You can find the login section by clicking on the login button (the icon with 3 people).

You can also use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+L

Clicking on the login button will open a side panel where you can login to your accounts.

To login to a website, click the blue Login button to the right of the website name you want to login to.

You will be asked to select a login profile. For now we will just use the default one and click Yes.

After selecting a login profile you will be met with some form of login screen. Most look something like this, but different websites require different ways of logging in.

This button will reset all cookies associated with the website. This only appears on websites that require you to login through their standard login page.

Close button that takes you back to the primary screen.

After you have logged into the website, close the login window. After a few seconds the account you logged in with should appear below the website name. Websites with logged in accounts will appear above those that have no accounts logged in.

Weasyl is now logged in and can be posted to.

> Tip: If you already have a logged in account under a website, you can click on the row to bring up the login screen, skipping the Profile Select popup.
