PostyBirb does not store or track your information anywhere on the internet. The only information that could potentially be stored is only stored on your computer and never sent anywhere else except for OAuth calls which are required for the usage of Twitter, Tumblr, and Mastodon. These web calls do not save your authentication tokens anywhere and are only used to make posts on your behalf.
