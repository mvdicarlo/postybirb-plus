## Open Source
PostyBirb's code is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/mvdicarlo/postybirb-plus).

## Why Did I Make PostyBirb?
A common complaint that I have heard is that it is annoying/tedious to post a single submission to many websites. Furthermore, a friend complained how annoying it was posting a piece of writing to multiple websites as well, having to remember all of the rules such as tag formatting. So I figured I would try to alleviate the burden on creators by making uploading a submission to multiple websites less of a time sink.

## Is PostyBirb Secure?
PostyBirb to the best of my knowledge is secure. Should any insecurities become known to me I will work to fix them as soon as possible.
At no point does PostyBirb store login information on any server. Login information is retained only on your computer, just like a browser.

### Two Types of Authentication
There are two different types of authentication used when posting to a website.
â€‹
### Natural Login
Some of the websites are authorized/enabled by logging into them once via the "Login" section of the application. This is comparable to logging into the website on your favorite web browser in which the application will utilize the cookies created during login (just like your browser) to upload to your account. 

### Authentication/Authorization
For websites that do not work with Natural Login and provide an API (Application Programming Interface) there is Authentication/Authorization. Before being able to use some websites, you will be asked to authorize the application in some manner. This allows PostyBirb to upload your submission to the authorized website(s) until the authorization expires or you revoke access yourself.

## What is PostyBirb made with?
PostyBirb is enabled to be a desktop application through the use of Electron
It is coded using Google's Angular framework and uses some NodeJS enabled through Electron.
Styling is a mixture of Material Design, Bootstrap, and my own custom CSS.
Currently PostyBirb is still in beta. This is mostly due to the fact that I cannot make up my mind on layouts.
I hope to soon exit beta after some final changes, clean up, and bug fixes.
