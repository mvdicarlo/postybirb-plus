## Descriptions

### ​Formatting

PostyBirb provides the user with a Rich Text Editor (TinyMCE).
A Rich Text Editor is provided so that users don't have to remember all the different formatting that each website has.

PostyBirb will make a best effort to transform the text you provide into a valid description for the target websites. However, there may be some inconsistencies, limitations, and missing features due to the difficulty of supporting each website's description requirements and quirks.

### Shortcuts

Use simple text shortcuts to easily link to a user's page. The application will do its best to format the link to satisfy each website's markdown.

These shortcuts can be found underneath the description box in the Shortcuts section.

## Tagging
### ​Formatting

PostyBirb makes a best effort to match the tagging systems of each website. For example if you give the tags "cat, dog, bus ride" it will appear on the posted to websites in a format it desires.

    Ink Bunny (cat, dog, bus_ride)
    SoFurry (cat, dog, bus ride)
    Fur Affinity (cat dog bus_ride)

### Defaults
Specify default tags to be sent to all websites.
These defaults can be added to per website or completely overridden.

## Saved Profiles
Save submission options, descriptions, websites, and tags under a profile name and apply it to future submissions with the click of a button.

## Schedule Submissions
Provide a time for a submission to be posted.
​
As long as the application is left open, when the time comes the submission will be posted.

## Multi-Posting
Queue up many submissions at once. PostyBirb will allow you to submit them all at once (in order).
​
​Submissions that have been saved in the application will remain in the submission gallery queue until posted or removed.

## Journal / Status Posting (JournalBirb)
PostyBirb also offers the same functionality for posting Journals and Statuses to your accounts.

Not all websites support this feature yet within the app.
